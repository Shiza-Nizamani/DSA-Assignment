## 🔍 Questions & Solutions

### 1. ✅ `ParenthesesMatcher.java`
- **Topic:** Stack – Parentheses Matching
- **Description:**  
  Checks whether a given string of parentheses (including `{}`, `[]`, and `()`) is balanced.  
  Uses a stack to track opening brackets and ensures they match closing ones properly.

---

### 2. ✅ `RecursiveArraySum.java`
- **Topic:** Recursion – Array Sum
- **Description:**  
  Takes an integer array as input and uses recursion to calculate the sum of all its elements.  
  Demonstrates how recursive functions can process arrays without loops.

---

### 3. ✅ `ReverseArrayUsingStack.java`
- **Topic:** Stack – Reverse Array
- **Description:**  
  Reads an array of integers from the user and uses a stack to reverse its elements.  
  Pushes each element to the stack, then pops them back into the array in reverse order.
