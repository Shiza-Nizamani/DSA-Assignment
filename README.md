📚 DSA Assignment – June 2025

Hi! 👋  
This is where I’ve uploaded my Java solutions for the DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) assignment we were given.

There are three programs in total , each one solves a different question using stacks or recursion.



 🔎 What Each File Does:

 🧩 ParenthesesMatcher.java
This program checks if the parentheses in a string are balanced or not.  
It uses a stack to match pairs like (), {}, and [] properly.

 🔁 RecursiveArraySum.java
Here I used recursion to find the sum of all elements in an array.  
It’s a simple recursive function that adds elements one by one.

 🔄 ReverseArrayUsingStack.java
This one takes an array input and reverses it using a stack.  
Basically, it pushes all values into the stack and then pops them out in reverse order.



 🛠 Tools I Used:

- Java
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Stack (Java’s built-in)
- Scanner for user input
- Basic recursion
